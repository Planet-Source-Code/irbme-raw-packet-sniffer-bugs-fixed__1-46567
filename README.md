### Description

This is an update to the first packet sniffer I submitted yestarday. It got alot of good feedback so I decided to resubmitt it with all the bugs fixed. It currently has support for 3 protocols (TCP, UDP and ICMP) and can very easily be expanded to include more. The packet sniffer itself is wrapped in a very object oriented fashoin allowing you to just plug it right into your own apps. NOTICE: This will only work on OS' with raw socket support (Windows XP/2000/NT) with root access (admin privilages).
